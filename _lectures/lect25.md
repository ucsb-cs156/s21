# Announcements

* Discuss how the #help-lecture-discussion channel works
  - Note that it's going to be quite busy over the next few days
* You can propose your own stories!  
  - Just put them on your Kanban board in the planning column.
  - You can start the story directly as an issue, then add it to your Kanban board.
  - Or, if you are pressed for time, or in the middle of something else, create it as a Card then convert to issue later.
  - Then, once it's reasonably well groomed (i.e. has a user story, acceptance criteria, etc.) ask a staff member to look it over,
  - Then drag into ToDo column.
* Bonus points
  - After the final deadline for earning points the "normal way" (by getting issues merged into the `main` branch) is done, your team can earn either 0, 5, 10
    or 15 bonus points by having a nice backlog of stories for the W22 class.
  - Stories in the backlog (Planning and ToDo) columns count towards bonus points only if they were proposed and/or groomed by the team, rather than the staff.
  - The better groomed and the more stories there are, the more likely you are to get more points (10 or 15 as opposed to 0 or 5).
  - You still can only get to maximum of 100 regular points, and 10 extra credit points (i.e. a max of 110)
