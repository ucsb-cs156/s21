# One last short homework assignment

We have one last homework assignment, which is more of the nature of a "reflection" piece.   It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes of time.

<https://www.gradescope.com/courses/255328/assignments/1334103>

I'm asking you to reflect on 
- what you learned in the course
- how you would talk about that at a job interview
- what advice you would give to future students or for future changes to the course
  

# Final Presentations

* Tuesday, June 8, noon-2:50 (Pacific Time), in the regular zoom room.
  - There will be one hour for each of the three projects.
  - UCSB courses search, noon-1pm 
  - Ten minute break: 1pm-1:10pm
  - UCSB CS LAs (1:10-2pm) (ten minute break)
  - Mapache (2-2:50)
* Each team will have 5-10 minutes to present, and then five minutes for live demo, plus Q&A by staff.

# More on Final Presentations

You may do it live, or you may do it pre-recorded via Video (uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo, or any other video sharing service.).

Here's a tutorial [video on making demo videos from CS48 S20](https://youtu.be/k0Je8ASh4jo) (Video inception)

Based on the experience of CS48 students, **pre-recording is strongly recommended**.  You will *know for sure* in advance whether the
demo is successful, and whether or not you've hit the target length of 5-10 minutes.

Your video should be 5 to 10 minutes long, and cover these points:

* First, mention the names of the members of the team, and introduce the person narrating the video.  
  - It is ok if all the team members appear in the video.  It is also ok if only one person narrates the video on behalf of the team.
* Second, go through each of the features that your team worked on that were merged into `main`
  - Only demo the features that were merged into `main`
  - Focus in this part of the video on demoing the features from a *user perspective*, not on the technical details of how they were implemented.
* Next, if there is time remaining to reach the 5-10 minute mark, you may briefly cover any technical and/or non-technical challenges your team faced
  - You don't have to cover everything.  
  - You don't really even have to include this part if your demo already hits the 5-10 minute range.
  - If you do include this part, focus on the items that you think would be interesting to the audience (fellow students in CS156 F20, and the staff of CS156 F20). 
  - Possible items to include
    - Particularly interesting technical details of what you had to write in the code
    - Challenges in testing
    - Challenges in team communication and organization, and what you did to overcome those
* Optional: at the end, if you like, you may thank anyone that was particularly helpful to the team from the staff (TAs and LAs, or students from other teams). 
  - Please don't include thanks to me (Prof. Conrad) in the video; I don't want this to be an exercise in brown-nosing.
  - If you do want to express gratitude, feel free to share your thoughts with me on the Slack, by email, etc.  

Please then also poll your team members and let me know your thoughts about the privacy of your final demo video:
* public, available to anyone that is interested in the app and the course
* unlisted, but ok to make it available to future CMPSC 156 students (as an example, and to orient them to the app)
* unlisted, and only shown once for this team's final demo, and to course staff 



# Final CATME.org survey

This will be opened immediately after the final course presentations, and will be open for 48 hours.

# Final Presentation Participation Assignment

(This will count as a participation assignment in your final course grade.)

* You'll be asked to critique each team's presentation, including your own.
  - Write down what you liked, and what could have been improved.
* You'll then be asked to put the presentations in one of three groups: top, middle, bottom.  
  - Give a brief justification (one sentence is enough)
* Each group must have either three or four presentations in it (total of 10).

* You are invited to consider these factors, and weigh them according to your own sense of how important they are:
  - Clarity of presentation: did you understand what the speakers were saying?
  - Impact on the application: how much did the team accomplish in terms of improving the application?
  - Presentation Style: Was the presentation enjoyable to listen to?
  - Working as a team: Did you have a sense from the presentation that the team worked well together and supported one another?


# Today's work

* 8 out of 12 teams are now at or above 100 points.
  - These teams should use the time to work on their final presentations
  - You may also go ahead and fill out the CATME peer evaluation 3
* All other teams:
  - Focus on getting PRs merged
  - We may have offered "quick win" stories (new PRs for those are ok)
  - We want those PRs ready to merge before lecture tomorrow.


# Suggestions for the final presentation planning process

You may undertake this any way you see fit.   The following is just a suggesiton of how to go about this, not a requirement.

1.  Perhaps start by listing the new features that your team contributed, focusing on what the user sees/experiences.
2.  For each of those, note who worked on those.
3.  Decide what order is best to present those features.
4.  Do a practice walk through of demoing those, and decide what that demo should look like.
5.  Decide if there are any other things you want to say in your video
    - Specific technical challenges that were interesting.
    - Specific non-technical challenges that were interesting.
    - Advice to future CS156 students on how to have a good experience in this course.
6.  List anyone specific you want to thank in terms of fellow students, LAs, TAs (omit Conrad, per the instructions; you may thank him in other contexts, but leave that out of the videos please!)

Decide whether you want to have multiple presenters, or just one presenter.

Then, try doing a run through with recording.   

# What happens to unfinished work?

If your team has already reached 100 or 110 points, it aises the question of what happens with issues that are still "in progress" or PRs that are still not yet merged into main.

If your team is already at above 100 points, there is no obligation to work on this for a "grade".

Having said that, there may be reasons you are motivated to continue, such as:
* You want or need to get from 100 or 105 to  >= 110 points in order to maximize your grade via extra credit.
* You are invested in the story, and want to see it through so that it makes it into the product.   You have worked hard, and want to see it across the finish line for the personal satisfaction.
* You still feel like you are learning, and you are more invested in the learning than in the grade.

For Whatever work is left "unfinished" from W21:  here's what happens:
* It becomes work for W22 teams.
* We will create a new issue that's a clone of the old issue; then link the new one to the old issue, old branch, and old PR if any.
* The new W22 teams may choose to start from scratch, or build on your work in progress, as they see fit.
